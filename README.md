**Substitution ciphers** are cryptographic techniques that involve replacing plaintext characters with ciphertext characters based on a defined system or key. There are several methods of substitution ciphers, each with its own way of mapping plaintext to ciphertext. Here are some common substitution cipher methods:

**1. Caesar Cipher:** This is one of the simplest substitution ciphers where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
**2. Monoalphabetic Cipher:** In this cipher, each letter in the plaintext is mapped to a unique letter in the ciphertext. The mapping remains constant throughout the encryption process. One example is the Atbash cipher, where letters are simply reversed (A becomes Z, B becomes Y, and so on).
**3. Polyalphabetic Cipher:** Unlike monoalphabetic ciphers, polyalphabetic ciphers use multiple alphabets for substitution. The most famous example is the Vigen√®re cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted according to a keyword. The keyword determines which alphabet to use for substitution at each position.
**4. Hill Cipher:** This cipher uses matrix multiplication to encrypt blocks of plaintext letters at a time. It is more complex than simple substitution ciphers and provides better security.
**5. Playfair Cipher:** In this method, a 5x5 grid of letters (usually excluding 'J' and using 'I' instead) is used to encrypt pairs of letters in the plaintext. The positions of letters in the grid determine the substitutions.
**6. Fiestel Cipher:** Feistel Cipher model is a structure or a design used to develop many block ciphers such as DES. Feistel cipher may have invertible, non-invertible and self invertible components in its design. Same encryption as well as decryption algorithm is used. A separate key is used for each round. However same round keys are used for encryption as well as decryption.
**7. One Time Pad Cipher:** One Time Pad algorithm is the improvement of the Vernam Cipher, proposed by An Army Signal Corp officer, Joseph Mauborgne. It is the only available algorithm that is unbreakable(completely secure). It is a method of encrypting alphabetic plain text. It is one of the Substitution techniques which converts plain text into ciphertext. In this mechanism, we assign a number to each character of the Plain-Text.
